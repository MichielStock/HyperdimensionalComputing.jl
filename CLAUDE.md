# CLAUDE.md - HyperdimensionalComputing.jl

## What is this package?

HyperdimensionalComputing.jl is a Julia package implementing Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) for hyperdimensional computing. HDC represents information as high-dimensional vectors (typically D=10,000) where three core operations — **bundling** (aggregation/superposition), **binding** (association/conjunction), and **permutation** (shifting) — are composed to encode arbitrary data structures. The high dimensionality guarantees that random vectors are quasi-orthogonal, enabling robust distributed representations.

## Supported vector types (all subtypes of `AbstractHV{T} <: AbstractVector{T}`)

| Type | Elements | Algebra | Key trait |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| `BinaryHV` | {false, true} (`Bool`, displays as 0/1) | BSC (Binary Spatter Codes) | BitVector storage |
| `BipolarHV` | {-1, +1} | MAP (Multiply-Add-Permute) | BitVector storage; bit `true ↦ -1`, `false ↦ +1`, so XOR on stored bits IS the ±1 product. Data must be exactly ±1; **zero elements throw** (use `TernaryHV`); Bool vectors are raw bits |
| `TernaryHV` | {-1, 0, +1} | MAP variant | Vector{Int} |
| `RealHV` | ℝ | Continuous MAP | Configurable distribution |
| `GradedHV` | [0, 1] | Fuzzy logic | Beta distribution default |
| `GradedBipolarHV` | [-1, 1] | Fuzzy logic bipolar | Scaled Beta default |
| `FHRR` | Complex unit circle | Fourier HRR | e^(iθ) elements, supports `^` |

Default dimension is 10,000 for all types. Layer taxonomy: **primitives** (operations.jl: bundle/bind/shift/perturbate) → **combinators** (encoding.jl: multiset, ngrams, ... — hypervectors in, hypervector out) → **encoders** (encode.jl: raw data in, hypervector out).

Constructor convention (settled; each form has exactly one meaning, documented on `AbstractHV`):

- `HV(; D = 10_000, seed = nothing, rng = Random.default_rng())` — random; `rng` takes an `AbstractRNG` **instance**, `seed` builds a fresh `Xoshiro(seed)`
- `HV(v::AbstractVector{<:Real})` — wrap element data, **validated** against the type's domain (BinaryHV {0,1}; BipolarHV ±1, zero errors pointing to TernaryHV; TernaryHV {-1,0,+1}; Graded types range-checked; FHRR unit modulus). Invalid arrays throw — they never silently token-encode
- `HV(x)` — token shorthand for `encode(HV, x)`; `HV(n::Number)` **throws an ArgumentError** naming both alternatives (`D = n` / `encode(HV, n)`) — this replaced the old one-time `@warn`
- Tuples of reals read as data, like vectors

`encode` is the canonical interface: `encode(HV, x; D)` is the deterministic token path (hash → seed), `encode(HV, x, strategy)` dispatches on `AbstractEncoding` strategies: `KMer(k)` (windows as atomic hashed tokens — resolves issue #53), `NGram(n)` (symbol-level shift-binding via `ngrams`), `Sequence()` (bundlesequence), `BagOfSymbols()` (multiset). New strategies = one struct + one `encode` method.

Stateful encoders live in the `AbstractEncoder{HV}` hierarchy (encode.jl): instances hold hypervector state built once at construction and slot in as the first argument of `encode`, with `decode` as the inverse. Two members: `LevelEncoder` encodes scalars against a shared level set (see below); `RandomProjection` encodes fixed-length real feature vectors (RGB triples, embeddings — **standardize features first**) through a shared `D × d` projection matrix (`z = R·x`, then a per-type nonlinearity: sign-like for binary/bipolar/ternary with a scalar-or-vector threshold `θ`, `β`-scaled identity/logistic/tanh for real/graded, `exp(im·β·z)` for FHRR). Matrix flavours: `:gaussian` (default), `:bipolar`, `:sparse_ternary`. Constructors: `RandomProjection(HV, d; D, matrix, θ, β, seed, rng)`, `RandomProjection(HV, R::AbstractMatrix; θ, β)` (supplied matrix), and a data-driven ternary form `RandomProjection(TernaryHV, X; target_sparsity)` that solves θ from data at construction (immutable — construction-from-data, not fitting; `rethreshold(rp, θ)` returns a new encoder sharing `R`). RP's `decode(rp, hv, references)` is nearest-neighbour clean-up only (no analytic inverse exists — the nonlinearity is lossy); it errors without a reference set. FHRR + `:gaussian` is exactly random Fourier features: similarity approximates a Gaussian kernel with bandwidth `β`. Both encoders' FHRR paths route through the single internal `phase_encode(z, β)` helper — never duplicate it.

Scalar `getindex` returns the element type `T`; non-scalar indexing returns a plain `Vector` of values, never a hypervector. Hypervectors are immutable (no `setindex!`).

## Core operations

| Operation | Function | Operator | Effect |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Bundle | `bundle(hvs)` | `+` | Superposition; result similar to all inputs |
| Bind | `bind(hv1, hv2)` | `*` | Association; result dissimilar to inputs |
| Unbind | `unbind(hv1, hv2)` | `/` | Inverse of bind (throws for `RealHV`: real MAP binding is not exactly invertible) |
| Shift | `shift(hv, k)` / `ρ(hv, k)` | — | Circular shift by k positions |
| Perturbate | `perturbate(hv, n_or_p)` | — | Flip n positions or fraction p |

In-place variants: `shift!`, `ρ!`, `perturbate!`.

## Encoding strategies (compose primitives into structured representations)

- `multiset(hvs)` — bundle a set of vectors
- `multibind(hvs)` — bind a set of vectors
- `bundlesequence(hvs)` / `bindsequence(hvs)` — ordered sequences via shift
- `hashtable(keys, values)` — key-value pairs via bind+bundle
- `crossproduct(U, V)` — cross product of two sets
- `ngrams(hvs, n)` — n-gram statistics for text/sequence encoding
- `graph(sources, targets)` — directed/undirected graph encoding

Numeric values are encoded with `LevelEncoder` (encode.jl), which replaced the old `level`/`encodelevel`/`decodelevel`/`convertlevel` function family. It builds its level set **once** at construction (the old family rebuilt it per call, producing incomparable encodings). Two mechanisms, selected by dispatch: a perturbation **ladder** for all types (`LevelEncoder(HV, range, n; bandwidth = 2/n)`, flip fraction per step) and **fractional power encoding** for FHRR (`LevelEncoder(FHRR, values; β)`, continuous via `base^(β·x)`; pass an explicit level count `n` to get a ladder instead). `encode(lvl, x)` maps a number to a hypervector; `decode(lvl, hv)` maps back via nearest-neighbour similarity (FHRR also supports `method = :analytic` for continuous, clean-vector decoding). `LevelEncoder(levels, values)` wraps precomputed hypervectors — this labelled-codebook form is the seam for a future shared item-memory abstraction.

## Similarity and inference

- `similarity(u, v)` / `δ(u, v)` — type-dispatched similarity (cosine for bipolar/real, Jaccard for binary/graded, complex dot for FHRR)
- `nearest_neighbor(u, collection)` — find closest match
- `nearest_neighbor(u, collection, k)` — k-nearest neighbors

## Key HDC/VSA concepts for contributors

- **Blessing of dimensionality**: random vectors in D~10,000 are quasi-orthogonal with high probability
- **Binding is self-inverse** for BSC/MAP (x * x = identity); FHRR unbinds exactly via elementwise complex division; RealHV binding is **not** exactly invertible (`unbind` throws)
- **Bundle preserves similarity** to inputs; bind produces dissimilar output
- **Shift encodes position** — used for sequences and n-grams
- All encodings are compositions of these three primitives
- The specific vector algebra matters less than the high dimensionality
