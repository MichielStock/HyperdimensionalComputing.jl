This function takes two hypervectors as input and returns a vector that is dissimilar to both. For bipolar vectors, this is an elementwise multiplication.

This functions aggragates two binary hypervectors to a new one that is similar to both. For bipolar vectors, this is possible by summing the elements at each position and returning their sign.

""" 
This functions aggragates two binary hypervectors to a new one that is similar to both. For binary vectors (where averaging 0 and 1 is not possible), this is done by randomly picking an element from each at every position. 
This way, two ones return a one, two zeros return a zero, and a one and a zero have a 50% chance of returning either.

DISCLAIMER: this solution to averaging binary vectors is a bit iffy, but might still work.

This function rotates a bipolar hypervector by a given degree in order to encode its position. 

DISCLAIMER: still to be benchmarked. This might not be the fastest way to do this as circshift creates new vectors and allocates extra memory to a vector that in this case will be instantly discarded.
